[size=xx-large][color=rgb(255, 0, 0)]Big Mac Modeler[/color][/size]

[b]Are you a Mac, or Linux, Modder but can't create Models because Techne is only Windows and MCModeler is outdated/not updating?[/b]
Well I'm here to answer all your prayers with my newest Program! It's a Modeler that actually WORKS on Mac and Linux!

[size=x-large]Instructions[/size]
[spoiler]
[size=large]Box Handling[/size]
[spoiler]
[size=medium][u]Adding a Box[/u][/size]
To create a new box, In the editor, click the Add Box button in the side panel.
What this will do is create a new box in the model.
The Coordinates will be 0 for the X, Y, and Z Positions!
The Rotation will also be 0.0 for all three sides!
The Size will actually be 1 length, 1 width, and 1 height.
All of there variables are customizable in the Model panel!

[size=medium][u]Selecting a Box[/u][/size]
There are two ways to select a box. 
The first way is to select it from the Boxes panel.
The Second way to select it is to aim the small '+' in the middle of the screen right at it!

[size=medium][u]Removing a Box[/u][/size]
To Remove a box, select it and click the Remove Box Button in the Model Panel.
This will remove it from the Model and will stop rendering it.
NOTE: If you remove a box from the model, it will still appear up in the Boxes panel, BUT will be invisible and won't get Generated in the model!
I will be fixing that in future updates, or maybe even in the next one!

[size=medium][u]Cloning a Box[/u][/size]
To Clone a box, select it and click the Clone Box button in the Model Panel.
This will clone the rotation, the size, and the location.
But! Know that Cloning a box will not clone the name exactly! It will add a number to the end of the name.
If there already is a box with that name, it will increase the number to add to the end!

[size=medium][u]Rotating a Box[/u][/size]
To Rotate a box, select it and modify the Rotations in the Model Panel.
Know that the rotation is done in radian and not in degrees!
What this means is that 2 PI is a full rotation! So if you put 6.28318530717959 (2 PI)...
The Model will be rotated a full rotation so it will look the same!
If you want it in degrees, multiply the degrees you want it to be by PI/180.
If you Know/Taken Trigonometry, You'll understand why that is what it is!

[size=medium][u]Scaling a Box[/u][/size]
To Scale a box, select it and modify the Sizes in the Model Panel.
This will not scale in on one side, but actually on both sides.
It's not like Techne, where if you increase the size, it will not increase on both sides, but only on the Y+ side.
Here, if you increase it, it will increase on both sides of the box.

[size=medium][u]Moving a Box[/u][/size]
To Translate (Move) a box, select it and modify the Positions in the Model Panel.
That will set it to that spot, respectively.
This is pretty simple, and doesn't really need to be explained but, Oh well...
Increasing the Y Position will place it higher in the model
Decreasing the Y Position will place it lower in the model
Changing the X or Z Position will place it on the same plane but in front or before in the model.
NOTE: When changing the Y position, sometimes, it might seem a bit higher than it really is.
That's because of the way I set the Y position in the Java Code

[size=large]Saving and Code Generation[/size]
[spoiler]
[size=medium][u]Code Generation[/u][/size]
Before generating the code, make sure none of your boxes have the same name!
If it does, when you generate it, the java file will have an error!

Once you're done with your model and you want to export it as Java Code.
Click the Generate Code button at the bottom of the Model panel.
After Clicking that button, it will name the java file the name you gave it when you clicked, New Model!
 * So... make sure the name is a valid Java Identifier! 
 * What this means is, if the name has something that is not allowed in a variable name in java, you'll get an error for that!
It will generate a .java file, with the name you gave it, in the folder Models next to the jar.
There will be only one error, if you did everything right. The error will most likely be for the Package name!
That's the only error you'll get in the code.
Other then that, all the imports are good, and all the code in general is, hopefully, error free!
 * If you do happen to get another error, don't hesitate to let me know!
Generating Code does save the Model to the 
 
Plug that into your Minecraft project/workspace, and it should work just like you wanted!

NOTE: The Code isn't just like you actually set it in the modeler!
The value you put in the modeler will, almost, always be different that the actual java file!

[size=large]Ingame FAQ[/size]
[spoiler]
Q: Is there a quick model scale option?
A: Sadly, no, I could implement that in future versions, because that might be a bit difficult. I suggest just manually doing everything so you're secure!

Q: The Model is a lot smaller then I wanted! How could I fix that?
A: Manually scale everything! Next time, try to use the Planks underneath the floor as a guide for your Model!

Q: Where's the Texture Map?
A: There isn't one and will be in future updates.

[size=large]Got an Error?[/size]
[spoiler]
[i]That Sucks! I was hoping that woudn't happen...[/i]

If you do get an error, or the program freezes or just shuts down unexpectedly, Follow these steps:
NOTE: Before continuing, make sure the program actually shut down, if not, close it beforehand!
Next to the jar, there should be a folder called Logs!
In that folder, there should be a file called 'latest log.txt'.
Copy everything in that and send that to me with a quick before and after of what happened.
A quick summary of what you were doing before the error and what you did after the error.
It would help me a lot if you could also give me any boxes you added or anything else!
